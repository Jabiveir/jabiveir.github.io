        <span title>JABIVEIR 3RD ANNIVERSARY!!</span><br>
        <span>First of all: sorry for not posting for so long,,, Rest assured, however, that I was
              working VERY hard in that time!<br>
              Secondly: happy Jabiveir Day!!! Today is June 17th, the anniversary of the release
              of Jabiveir Quest and this website as a whole. Since it came out in 2022, that marks
              three years of Jabiveir! And, as I hope will become tradition, I have some pretty big
              things prepared. The first of which is,,,<br><br>
              <b>THE RELEASE OF JABICHAT!!</b><br>
              That's right, after around half a year in development, JabiChat is FINALLY ready for
              public release.<br>
              Of course, this doesn't mean that it's <i>done</i>. There are still a ton of things
              that I want to add (and bugs to fix immediately after release, I imagine), but it now
              is ready enough to be publicly used, and thus I'm probably gonna take a break from it
              for a while (after fixing all the release-day bugs).<br>
              You can start using JabiChat NOW from the main site page or by putting
              https://chat.jabiveir.com into your URL bar!<br><br>
              <b>RSS Support</b><br>
              If JabiChat won't be enough to notify you of website news, then you can use the newly
              added Jabiveir RSS feed!<br>
              If you don't have an RSS aggregator yet, then you should get one immediately, because
              they are awesome. I recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuiteRSS">QuiteRSS</a>
              (download <a href="https://quiterss.org/files/0.19.4_/">here</a>) because it's free,
              simple, and has a lovely aesthetic!<br>
              To use this site's RSS feed, simply copy the RSS link (found on the main site page)
              into your RSS aggregator (that's how it works for QuiteRSS at least, I'm uncertain
              about other programs).<br><br>
              <b>Future Plans</b><br>
              As you may have seen on the main site, the Jabiveir Wiki has been blocked off for
              renovations. That is because, with JabiChat finally being ready for release, I'm
              finally free to move on to updating the wiki into Jabipedia! My plans for the pages 
              have changed, so I will be rewriting most of it, and I want to finish all of it before 
              release, so it will unfortunately be a little while before it's done (though not seven
              months! Hopefully,,,); I've already been making fairly steady progress, though. This release will also
              be accompanied by minor updates to each of my previous games, for reasons that will
              become obvious when the update arrives. Past that, I'd like to update the main site page
              to look better (with a different format for mobile users), which shouldn't be too
              difficult.

        <span title>Progress Update #2</span><br>
        <span>Well, doing these weekly fell apart pretty quickly.</span><br><br>
        <span>Shortly after the last post, I started getting slammed with homework, and any time that I wasn't busy, I didn't feel motivated enough to work on the site.</span><br><br>
        <span>Since the last progress update, the only work I've gotten done was yesterday, but it was a fairly significant amount. Luckily, homework is easing up a bit and Spring Break is next week, so I should have a lot more time to work on JabiChat.</span><br><br>
        <span>I think I've decided to wait to update Jabipedia until the public beta release of JabiChat. I've really only been thinking about JabiChat anyway, so it's hardly a change in plan. Hopefully it won't take too long to get to it. I also noticed that the past two posts were marked as being posted in 2024 instead of 2025; this has since been fixed.</span>

        <span title>Progress Update #1</span><br>
        <span>I didn't make too much progress on JabiChat this week, but I did fix a few bugs, add dynamic favicons, and add the option to leave chatrooms. Unfortunately, I didn't get anything done in regards to Jabipedia (including actually changing its name), but I'm hoping to get to that this coming week.</span><br><br>
        <span>I've been having some pretty significant difficulty getting work done lately, both for the website and for school, but I think I'll be able to get back into the swing of things soon.</span><br><br>
        <span>These progress updates are likely to be much shorter than previous blog posts, but they'll at least be more frequent (hopefully). I might end up padding them out with any personal stuff that comes to mind. I also noticed that I had the previous post marked as posted in January instead of February; oops! This has since been fixed.</span>

        <span title>Oops. (Catching Up)</span><br>
        <span>It's been a while. My bad!</span><br><br>
        <span>Soon after my previous two blog posts, I got extremely busy and mostly stopped thinking about the site at all. I eventually got around to working on JabiChat (a LOT), but I didn't really think much about this blog. I intend to be more diligent about updating this in the future, but that might end up being unlikely.</span><br><br>
        <span>Speaking of JabiChat, I haven't spent 5 months doing *nothing* (only 4!), and I managed to cobble together a closed beta. It went quite well, although there is definitely more work to be done before the beta can go public, as some pretty important features are missing, but it's in a fairly good state right now. If I can get myself to work on it consistently, I think I could be able to get the beta public in around a month.</span><br><br>
        <span>Obviously, waiting another month without anything new isn't gonna be great, so I intend to post progress updates on here (at least weekly) (hopefully), along with working more on the Wiki.</span><br><br>
        <span>My first plan for the Jabiveir Wiki is to rename it, as I've found out that, by definition, it is not at all a wiki. I think the new name will be "Jabipedia" (short for "Jabiveir Encyclopedia"), but I'm not yet sure about it. I would also like to rewrite some of the already-finished pages before I move on to new ones.</span><br><br>
        <span>If you've got any suggestions anything on the site, or you just want to nag me into working, feel free to contact me! (For most of my current audience, that just means telling me in person or over social media, but just in case, you can e-mail me at jabiveir2@gmail.com)</span>

        <span title>JabiWiki and Other Plans</span><br>
        <span>The Wiki page for "Five Nights at Jabiveir's" is now out!</span><br><br>
        <span>That certainly isn't enough for a blog post on its own, so I'd also like to discuss my specific plans for the Wiki, as well as some changes to my plans for JabiChat. For the Wiki, I have several pages that I still want to make, including one for the rest of my games, a page for upcoming and cancelled projects, a page just about Jabiveir in general, and a page for the Jabiveir Website itself. The main reason that I want to change my plans a bit is mainly because of the Jabiveir Website page, as I intend for it to include a list of site-wide achievements. I have a few ideas for what achievements I would want to put in, but implementing the achievements is likely going to be the most time-consuming part of the entire Jabiveir Wiki's development.</span><br><br>
        <span>This brings me to my new plan: my main focus is still going to be on building the Wiki, but before I continue with that, I will try to put up a rudimentary alpha version of JabiChat, and the two will then be developed in parallel. This is certainly going to make it take longer for both to be developed than if I were to just work on one and then the other, but I think it's important to get JabiChat up and running in some capacity as soon as is feasible, because most of the bugs are going to be ones that I'm only going to be able to find by having people use the application, so I would want people using it as soon as I can manage; also, this gives more opportunity for user suggestions to be baked into the foundation of the application, which will make it much better in the end.</span><br><br>
        <span>I have no clue how long it will take to build JabiChat's alpha, but I'll be working on it for (hopefully) most of this weekend, and I'll be sure to make another post when it's out.</span>

        <span title>First Post and Site Reformat</span><br>
        <span>Hello! This is the first blog post that I'm making for this website. I intend to have these detail my plans and progress in regards to upcoming projects semi-frequently, so releases don't seem as random.</span><br><br>
        <span>Currently, I've got a lot planned (as you may be able to intuit from the entire site reformat). Now that the site is looking better, I plan to finish the Jabiveir Wiki; this is probably going to take quite a while, so I'm going to release each page as I finish them instead of waiting to have them all complete to release (as was the original plan). After the wiki, I want to get a rudimentary alpha version of JabiChat, a messaging app, up and running; this will be updated over time, hopefully with user requests, and it will also be another way to contact me aside from just my e-mail. After JabiChat, I have two games in mind that I want to make: Idle Rythm, which is already around half done, and Jabiveir Quest 2, which I plan to be a HUGE RPG choose-your-own-adventure game (but that will take a LONG time to make). Past that, I'd like to make some useful free software like music and art creation tools, as well as some silly, less useful stuff.</span><br><br>
        <span>While these plans are subject to change, I'm hoping that I can stick to them and get through them relatively quickly (especially considering this is the first real update I've made to the site since January).</span><br><br>
        <span>Thank you for reading, and I hope you have fun on the site!</span>
