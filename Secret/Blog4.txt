Forgot twice again :P

Sunday was pretty good; I was productive most of the day, and I watched Mission: Impossible 3 with family (I forgot how good that one was). Yesterday was a bit worse, but still decent; I didn't do much of anything until near midnight, at which point I had to rush to do an assignment for Intro to Programming. Today is seeming similar to yesterday, but now that I'm thinking about it, not only do I still have a bunch of time left, but also my last class only ended like 2.5 hours ago, so I haven't really wasted *that* much time. I should still get working now, though.

I also saw a policeman on a horse today when I was walking back from class. I had never really realized until now how huge horses are. I have no clue why they were there though.

I've been wanting to do something for my website, but I feel like I've gotta get on top of my schoolwork first. I've also been wanting to get a job, join/found a club, watch a bunch of things on my to-watch list, and start reading. I meant to make that a long, exhaustive list to illustrate (mostly to myself) that I can't really achieve all of these things at once, but honestly it seems pretty doable (unless I'm forgetting something, which I probably am). My biggest obstacle is still my schoolwork though, and by that I mean I need to get myself to realize that there's always going to be schoolwork, so I shouldn't try to wait until I have none left to start everything else.

Okay I got sidetracked and forgot to actually post that. And now I've wasted more time. Bluh.

Maybe I should stop thinking of time not spent working as being wasted. But also I feel like that will lead directly to less work being done. IDK

I applied for position(s) at my campus's libraries with a newly-improved resume and a newly-made cover letter. I'm fairly confident I'll get a response, but I could honestly see it going either way. I also added an "About" section to the main site, which I felt like it needed.
