Hi! This is the second block of this blog. Unless you're real good at gathering things from inference, I would suggest reading the first block before this one to get some context; I don't wanna write a whole bunch of recap. This block will end at the end of September (if I remember).

Anyway, I HATE THE UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA!!! I am, unfortunately, a picky eater, so there are very few things there that I like, none of them are healthy, and there doesn't seem to be a SINGLE consistently available menu item. I just went down there, and I wanted to get a burger, fries, and apple juice. I go to the burger station, a woman is cooking there, but she says that it's closed. Okay. I settle for having pasta instead, I go to the pasta station, and theres no plates. Alright. I go get a plate from a different station, get some pasta, then go to get fries. I see a person taking out every last remaining fry from the tray. Annoying, but fine. I go to get my apple juice, put my cup under the dispenser labelled "APPLE JUICE", and water comes out. Now I'm pissed.

I would absolutely LOVE to just stop going, but for first-year students, they FORCE you to buy a meal plan for the cafeteria, and the cheapest option (which I got) is TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SEMESTER. We're already struggling to pay for all of this, so adding on food to that sunk cafeteria cost isn't very viable, so I'm just stuck dealing with this miserable place for the entire school year. Typically in a situation like this, I would think to myself, "Oh, well, I've made it this far! Surely I can see it through!" The problem with that, though, is that it has been THREE WEEKS. Grumble grumble grumble,,,,

Anywho, the rest of the day was fine. Got some work done, but less than I would have liked. Won't have anything due until Saturday now, though, which is nice (and should give me time to do the Ethics stuff that I STILL HAVEN'T DONE). I'm kinda left wondering where all the time went today; I really don't feel like I wasted that much time, but I barely spent any time actually getting stuff done. Curious. I got a really high daily score today, though (and there's still room to get it higher)!

Played Terraria all day today. Again. I should really just take a break, but I've been meaning to finally beat the game without Journey Mode for a long while now, and I know that if my break lasts too long, I'll forget all the details of my world and just want to start a new one. At least this is a good time of the school year to do this; I don't have that much to do yet (I think. I still haven't even looked at my Ethics stuff).

LOCKED IN at the end! Thank you to that one person that made a very motivational Reddit post. Also had a fun time with my roommates to end the night. AND I got a new personal best on my daily score (mostly from the consistency bonus since yesterday was so productive). Overall, great day!
