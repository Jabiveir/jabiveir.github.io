Hi! This is the second block of this blog. Unless you're real good at gathering things from inference, I would suggest reading the first block before this one to get some context; I don't wanna write a whole bunch of recap. This block will end at the end of September (if I remember).

Anyway, I HATE THE UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA!!! I am, unfortunately, a picky eater, so there are very few things there that I like, none of them are healthy, and there doesn't seem to be a SINGLE consistently available menu item. I just went down there, and I wanted to get a burger, fries, and apple juice. I go to the burger station, a woman is cooking there, but she says that it's closed. Okay. I settle for having pasta instead, I go to the pasta station, and theres no plates. Alright. I go get a plate from a different station, get some pasta, then go to get fries. I see a person taking out every last remaining fry from the tray. Annoying, but fine. I go to get my apple juice, put my cup under the dispenser labelled "APPLE JUICE", and water comes out. Now I'm pissed.

I would absolutely LOVE to just stop going, but for first-year students, they FORCE you to buy a meal plan for the cafeteria, and the cheapest option (which I got) is TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SEMESTER. We're already struggling to pay for all of this, so adding on food to that sunk cafeteria cost isn't very viable, so I'm just stuck dealing with this miserable place for the entire school year. Typically in a situation like this, I would think to myself, "Oh, well, I've made it this far! Surely I can see it through!" The problem with that, though, is that it has been THREE WEEKS. Grumble grumble grumble,,,,

Anywho, the rest of the day was fine. Got some work done, but less than I would have liked. Won't have anything due until Saturday now, though, which is nice (and should give me time to do the Ethics stuff that I STILL HAVEN'T DONE). I'm kinda left wondering where all the time went today; I really don't feel like I wasted that much time, but I barely spent any time actually getting stuff done. Curious. I got a really high daily score today, though (and there's still room to get it higher)!

Played Terraria all day today. Again. I should really just take a break, but I've been meaning to finally beat the game without Journey Mode for a long while now, and I know that if my break lasts too long, I'll forget all the details of my world and just want to start a new one. At least this is a good time of the school year to do this; I don't have that much to do yet (I think. I still haven't even looked at my Ethics stuff).

LOCKED IN at the end! Thank you to that one person that made a very motivational Reddit post. Also had a fun time with my roommates to end the night. AND I got a new personal best on my daily score (mostly from the consistency bonus since yesterday was so productive). Overall, great day!

I signed up for an online meeting for building resumes and stuff (since I think my resume is terrible), but I only realized last night that the meeting was in the middle of my Arduino class today. So, I had to go to my Arduino class, check out the kit that's needed to do the assignments, leave immediately, then go back to my dorm, join the meeting, and look at the class slides and do the assignment on my own. I was perfectly fine with that, but then I joined the meeting, and it turned out that the meeting had been cancelled due to technical difficulties. The host sent out notifications about this through Handshake (some website), but I signed up for the meeting through Get Involved (some other website), which recieved no such notification. So I basically skipped class for nothing. Grumble grumble grumble

Didn't end up doing too much today, but I still had a good time. That seems to be a recurring theme.

Also almost got scammed out of all of the money in my and my father's bank accounts. Oops. For my readers: if you get unsolicited e-mail about any sort of remote assistance job offer, there is a 99% chance it is a scam. They get you (generally) by asking for your bank, its routing number, and your account number; employers need these three things to set up direct deposit, but they can also be used to make fraudulent transactions with your bank account. What tipped me off in this case, aside from the general too-good-to-be-true offer, was that they accepted my application very quickly without needing a resume or cover letter or anything, and that they never once mentioned the name of the organization that they were working with (it was a sort of 'personal assistant' job). While these might seem like fairly obvious things, they can be very subtle in the moment; if I weren't so paranoid, I wouldn't have thought twice about this offer, and I would've gotten scammed. When it comes to money, NEVER LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!

Anyway, I also went to family dinner and it was nice. I would like to bear down and get a bunch of work done tomorrow, but I think we all now how this story goes by now. Although, it might be my acute awareness and acceptance of this flaw that's exacerbating it; whenever I commit to closing all my social media and make a strict plan to spend a day working, I almost always follow through. I guess I'll try that tomorrow.
