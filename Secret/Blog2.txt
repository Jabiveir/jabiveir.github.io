Hi! This is the second block of this blog. Unless you're real good at gathering things from inference, I would suggest reading the first block before this one to get some context; I don't wanna write a whole bunch of recap. This block will end at the end of September (if I remember).

Anyway, I HATE THE UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA!!! I am, unfortunately, a picky eater, so there are very few things there that I like, none of them are healthy, and there doesn't seem to be a SINGLE consistently available menu item. I just went down there, and I wanted to get a burger, fries, and apple juice. I go to the burger station, a woman is cooking there, but she says that it's closed. Okay. I settle for having pasta instead, I go to the pasta station, and theres no plates. Alright. I go get a plate from a different station, get some pasta, then go to get fries. I see a person taking out every last remaining fry from the tray. Annoying, but fine. I go to get my apple juice, put my cup under the dispenser labelled "APPLE JUICE", and water comes out. Now I'm pissed.

I would absolutely LOVE to just stop going, but for first-year students, they FORCE you to buy a meal plan for the cafeteria, and the cheapest option (which I got) is TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SEMESTER. We're already struggling to pay for all of this, so adding on food to that sunk cafeteria cost isn't very viable, so I'm just stuck dealing with this miserable place for the entire school year. Typically in a situation like this, I would think to myself, "Oh, well, I've made it this far! Surely I can see it through!" The problem with that, though, is that it has been THREE WEEKS. Grumble grumble grumble,,,,

Anywho, the rest of the day was fine. Got some work done, but less than I would have liked. Won't have anything due until Saturday now, though, which is nice (and should give me time to do the Ethics stuff that I STILL HAVEN'T DONE). I'm kinda left wondering where all the time went today; I really don't feel like I wasted that much time, but I barely spent any time actually getting stuff done. Curious. I got a really high daily score today, though (and there's still room to get it higher)!

Played Terraria all day today. Again. I should really just take a break, but I've been meaning to finally beat the game without Journey Mode for a long while now, and I know that if my break lasts too long, I'll forget all the details of my world and just want to start a new one. At least this is a good time of the school year to do this; I don't have that much to do yet (I think. I still haven't even looked at my Ethics stuff).

LOCKED IN at the end! Thank you to that one person that made a very motivational Reddit post. Also had a fun time with my roommates to end the night. AND I got a new personal best on my daily score (mostly from the consistency bonus since yesterday was so productive). Overall, great day!

I signed up for an online meeting for building resumes and stuff (since I think my resume is terrible), but I only realized last night that the meeting was in the middle of my Arduino class today. So, I had to go to my Arduino class, check out the kit that's needed to do the assignments, leave immediately, then go back to my dorm, join the meeting, and look at the class slides and do the assignment on my own. I was perfectly fine with that, but then I joined the meeting, and it turned out that the meeting had been cancelled due to technical difficulties. The host sent out notifications about this through Handshake (some website), but I signed up for the meeting through Get Involved (some other website), which recieved no such notification. So I basically skipped class for nothing. Grumble grumble grumble

Didn't end up doing too much today, but I still had a good time. That seems to be a recurring theme.

Also almost got scammed out of all of the money in my and my father's bank accounts. Oops. For my readers: if you get unsolicited e-mail about any sort of remote assistance job offer, there is a 99% chance it is a scam. They get you (generally) by asking for your bank, its routing number, and your account number; employers need these three things to set up direct deposit, but they can also be used to make fraudulent transactions with your bank account. What tipped me off in this case, aside from the general too-good-to-be-true offer, was that they accepted my application very quickly without needing a resume or cover letter or anything, and that they never once mentioned the name of the organization that they were working with (it was a sort of 'personal assistant' job). While these might seem like fairly obvious things, they can be very subtle in the moment; if I weren't so paranoid, I wouldn't have thought twice about this offer, and I would've gotten scammed. When it comes to money, NEVER LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!

Anyway, I also went to family dinner and it was nice. I would like to bear down and get a bunch of work done tomorrow, but I think we all now how this story goes by now. Although, it might be my acute awareness and acceptance of this flaw that's exacerbating it; whenever I commit to closing all my social media and make a strict plan to spend a day working, I almost always follow through. I guess I'll try that tomorrow.

Didn't work. Bluhhhhhh

IT WORKED!!!! HUZZAH! I am a champion of discipline and a golden god of diligence.

From noon until half an hour ago, the only things that I have done are work and eat. I feel like most people would look back at a day like this and feel miserable, but I only feel untold exuberance. There were a bunch of points throughout the day where I thought to myself, "I should just take a quick break. I should do some of this tomorrow. Nyeh nyeh nyeh" BUT I PRESSED ON!! I DID NOT STOP!! I took that little part of my brain that wants to do nothing all day and CHOKED IT INTO SILENCE. I feel unstoppable right now.

My main strategy involved taking my planned bedtime and my start time, then estimating how much time each task would take me (making sure to overestimate), and then subtracting my projected work time from my total time in the day. This left me with 2.5 hours of lenience. I then realized that, if I kept to my schedule strictly enough, I would have enough time at the end of the day to fit in a Mission: Impossible movie, which stopped me from abusing my lenience. It's good that I did that, and it's good that I tried to overestimate how much time each thing would take me, because I went overtime on literally every task (oops!). I also took breaks from working to go eat, which I did in the cafeteria, meaning that there was no screen or TV to watch or anything, making that break function as a full mental rest (which is probably the only thing that kept me from burning out and crashing) without risking getting distracted and wasting a bunch of extra time. These are all very valuable strategies that I will try to employ in the future! I do feel like it involved a fair amount of luck in several places though, so it will be rather hard to replicate. Nevertheless, I AM ELATED!

It's not cheating with the time. I swear. I made it in time it's okay.

Didn't get much productive done today, just finished my resume. It took me surprisingly long to make it; I am very bad at writing about myself. I'm gonna apply for a custodian position soon, but I need to get a copy of my birth certificate first as proof of citizenship (and I should also get a state ID while I'm at it, since I don't have a driver's license). That'll probably have to be next weekend, since I think I'll have to go back home for that.

On the non-productive side of things, though, I did quite a bit! I progressed a lot in my Terraria world (I'm finally playing through the game without Journey Mode, though jumping right into Expert may have been unwise), I had a fun voice call with my Secret Society, and perhaps most importantly, I finally got back to making Jabi Comix!! Hopefully, I'll continue making them a lot more consistently, now that I'm settled into college.

Speaking of Jabi Comix, I really wanna actually get good at art, but I just don't really know if I can do it. I know that I have the potential capability to get good, if I just work hard and consistently enough, but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep that consistency or put enough of my time towards it. Plus, with my art skill currently being quite bad, I don't want to publish anything I make, and even without the thought of publishing, it still makes me averse to trying. I can fall back on making funny stuff that doesn't need to be high-quality, but I don't think that's ever gonna push my limits enough to allow me to actually improve; it'll just give me a decent-looking low-quality art style. It also doesn't help that I have a really hard time coming up with original ideas. I have this exact same issue with making music, as well. Oh well! At least I'm good at a bunch of other stuff. Like going to bed on time! Wuh oh.
