Okay, firstly, sorry for missing blog posts for 3 days. Honestly, I don't really know why that happened. It sorta feels like a ton has been going on recently, but there was still a lot of time spent doing nothing (as per usual), so IDRK why it kept slipping my mind to update this.

Secondly, IT WAS SOY!!!
As the astute readers remember, I've been experiencing a lot of fatigue recently, as well as just general difficulty with thinking (the latter of which I haven't really expressed as much on here), and I have pretty bad acne. Something I haven't mentioned on here (mostly because I thought it was normal in regards to how much I ate) is that I consistently feel bloated after eating. So, that leads us to a few days ago, when as per usual, I am wasting time on YouTube when I should be doing something important.

It's some video about protein combining or whatever, and I'm just looking through the comments, and I saw a random thread about diet-related stuff making people moody and tired; being in a desperate mood and too tired to do anything more important, I went through the thread looking into each of the little nutrients and supplements and whatnot that people were talking about. Then, I come across someone saying that they have a soy allergy, so I look up the symptoms and get a result for soy intolerance. Fatigue, brain fog, skin issues, and gastrointestinal issues. It seemed like a perfect fit, so I looked to see if the stuff I was eating had much soy.

Literally EVERY meal that I had been eating for the past month (and likely even further than that) contained soy. It is genuinely insane to me how prevalent it is.

Fortunately, the burgers in the campus cafeteria don't contain soy, so I stopped eating the fries (which do) with them, and replaced them with a slice of pizza. Obviously, this is not a very healthy diet, but it has been like two or three days of this, and the change has been SO DRASTIC! My skin is clearing up, my stomach feels fine after eating, and I finally feel like I have full control over my brain for the first time in MONTHS!

I'm still not *certain* that it's soy (despite the seemingly positive results, there are still a bunch of possible confounding variables), but I'm going home next weekend, and McDonald's, Burger King, and Little Caesar's food all contains soy, and it's more than likely that we'll get one of those while I'm there, so if the symptoms come back shortly after, I'll pretty much have confirmation.

Also, as of today, I feel like I have a much easier time just chilling out and taking a break, even when something is undone and urgently due (which, as you may have guessed, happened today). I'm not sure how much of that is related to the intolerance, though; it could've been a sort of emotional epiphany unrelated to my diet, or it could've been the change in diet that gave me the emotional stability and mental clarity that I needed. Either way, I'm absolutely gonna try to keep this going for as long as possible.

I also managed to make my Dracula prank work over the weekend, but this post is already way long, so I'll explain that either tomorrow or whenever there's an update on the Dracula situation.
