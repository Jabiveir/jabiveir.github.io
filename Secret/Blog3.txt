Okay, firstly, sorry for missing blog posts for 3 days. Honestly, I don't really know why that happened. It sorta feels like a ton has been going on recently, but there was still a lot of time spent doing nothing (as per usual), so IDRK why it kept slipping my mind to update this.

Secondly, IT WAS SOY!!!
As the astute readers remember, I've been experiencing a lot of fatigue recently, as well as just general difficulty with thinking (the latter of which I haven't really expressed as much on here), and I have pretty bad acne. Something I haven't mentioned on here (mostly because I thought it was normal in regards to how much I ate) is that I consistently feel bloated after eating. So, that leads us to a few days ago, when as per usual, I am wasting time on YouTube when I should be doing something important.

It's some video about protein combining or whatever, and I'm just looking through the comments, and I saw a random thread about diet-related stuff making people moody and tired; being in a desperate mood and too tired to do anything more important, I went through the thread looking into each of the little nutrients and supplements and whatnot that people were talking about. Then, I come across someone saying that they have a soy allergy, so I look up the symptoms and get a result for soy intolerance. Fatigue, brain fog, skin issues, and gastrointestinal issues. It seemed like a perfect fit, so I looked to see if the stuff I was eating had much soy.

Literally EVERY meal that I had been eating for the past month (and likely even further than that) contained soy. It is genuinely insane to me how prevalent it is.

Fortunately, the burgers in the campus cafeteria don't contain soy, so I stopped eating the fries (which do) with them, and replaced them with a slice of pizza. Obviously, this is not a very healthy diet, but it has been like two or three days of this, and the change has been SO DRASTIC! My skin is clearing up, my stomach feels fine after eating, and I finally feel like I have full control over my brain for the first time in MONTHS!

I'm still not *certain* that it's soy (despite the seemingly positive results, there are still a bunch of possible confounding variables), but I'm going home next weekend, and McDonald's, Burger King, and Little Caesar's food all contains soy, and it's more than likely that we'll get one of those while I'm there, so if the symptoms come back shortly after, I'll pretty much have confirmation.

Also, as of today, I feel like I have a much easier time just chilling out and taking a break, even when something is undone and urgently due (which, as you may have guessed, happened today). I'm not sure how much of that is related to the intolerance, though; it could've been a sort of emotional epiphany unrelated to my diet, or it could've been the change in diet that gave me the emotional stability and mental clarity that I needed. Either way, I'm absolutely gonna try to keep this going for as long as possible.

I also managed to make my Dracula prank work over the weekend, but this post is already way long, so I'll explain that either tomorrow or whenever there's an update on the Dracula situation.

Ohhhhh I am so very happy with myself today! Well, maybe not *today* so much as the last few hours.

Here's the situation: my ethics midterm is next week, and the class is self-paced, meaning that all of the assignments are due this Sunday (5 days from today). I am three weeks behind. The assignments are packaged in weekly modules, and each module is very interconnected, so I consider the whole thing to be one assignment; this means that I have 3 very long assignments to do in 5 days. I was very committed to getting one done today, but I let time slip by until it was around 9 PM; one of these assignments usually takes me around 3 to 4 hours, and I want decent sleep, so I figured I missed my shot and that I could not do the whole thing tonight.

Suddenly, a bright thought emerges: "Okay, well, I can't do the whole thing, but I can at least do half tonight (the relevant readings) and do the rest tomorrow, which will still put me in a better position." However, since I had so carelessly let time slip away, I figured I was far too distractible at the moment to get any meaningful amount of reading done and/or retain any of it. Normally, I'm quite certain, this is where I would have gotten all mopey and given up. But! I decided to just try it out to see, and if I got too easily distracted, I would just quit early and relax for the night.

I swear to you, I got through that assignment faster than I have ever done it before. Not just the half of it that I had planned to do. THE WHOLE THING. It's INSANE.

There was still a modicum of doubt in my mind about whether or not it truly was the soy causing my issues, but no more. where doing it man. where MAKING THIS HAPEN.

I'm probably just gonna wait on more Dracula developments to explain that because this post is once again long and I am once again sleepy GOODNIGHT

Okay, perhaps the soy-free diet wasn't quite as great as I thought. In addition to missing blog-posting for three days, I got basically nothing done in that time (until yesterday) and my acne came back with a vengeance. HOWEVER, this doesn't necessarily disprove the theory, because I was distracted from doing work by getting super into Terraria again, and to offset the Calorie loss from cutting the soy-containing meals from my diet, I started drinking soda and juice every day, which is bad for my acne because of all the sugar, and the remaining Calorie loss may have also led to fatigue, worsening my work issues.

Fortunately, all  of this is fixable! I came back home for the weekend yesterday, and I've already been more productive (any time I hadn't spent watching movies or eating dinner with my parents, I spent doing homework) simply because I don't have Terraria on my laptop (not that it could run it anyway :P). Later today, we're gonna go to the store to get me a bunch of soy-free food, which should help with my acne and slight fatigue.

Unfortunately, I'm probably not gonna stop playing Terraria, because I'm not even yet at the spot where I quit last time, and if I stop playing for too long then I'll forget the details of my world and want to start another one, and I REALLY wanna finally beat Expert Mode (which will also be my very first time beating the game without Journey Mode). However, I think I can have the best of both worlds if I just stop playing the game in splitscreen, with YouTube playing on the other half of the screen. As silly as this may sound, Terraria is a fairly mentally-intensive game, and watching YouTube alongside it can be pretty draining, which I think is leaving me too tired to actually do work; plus, if I'm not watching YouTube with it, I'll probably get bored of the game a bit more quickly, which should prevent me from spending the entire day on it.

This weekend, I've got quite a bit of homework to do (along with a bunch of other stuff), but pretty much everything is due by Sunday night, and this week is Fall Break, meaning that I also have Monday and Tuesday off, so I can spend that time however I want. Since I don't have games, of course, I'll basically be forced to use that time to work on my board game; the final stroke of my master plan! I can't recall if I've ever mentioned my board game on here (I think I have), but if I haven't: I'm making a board game.

Meant to update again yesterday, but I forgot. I got picked up by my friends and had a good time with them, but I ended up not doing the homework I meant to get done, which means that I need to do all of it today (because it's all due today). Fortunately, I am LOCKED IN! I went to bed at 10 last night, woke up at 7 today, and I'm ready to go. Hopefully. Definitely.
