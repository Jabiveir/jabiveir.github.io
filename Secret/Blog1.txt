Hello! Welcome to my awesome blog. This is basically going to function as public(ish) journaling; I've been thinking it would be cool, and I couldn't sleep tonight, so I figured now was as good a time to start as any. Now I'm thinking I should've thought this through a bit more, though, because I don't really know what to write now. I suppose I'll just write things as they happen and provide prior context as needed.

As I'm writing this, this blog is basically the only thing in the Jabi Corner, but I will probably put more stuff here in the future (like my non-blog musings and Guy 4 if I ever get around to actually working on it). I would just make this the normal website instead of a secret section of it, but I advertise(d) the website a bit too much, so I feel like it needs to appear semi-professional at least on the surface. Rest assured, this will be where the real magic happens,,,, (if I remember to put more stuff on it. And remember to update this blog)

If you have comments, questions, or et ceteras in response to any of my bloggings, you can always contact me at jabiveir2@gmail.com (or more direct methods, which, if you're here, you probably have).

Okay, I guess I did have a lot to write.

Finally, onto personal matters! I'm really hungry and I should have eaten dinner


10:12
Just woke up. Relatively early considering I went to bed at like 02:30 or something. My sleep schedule has been pretty bad all summer. Hopefully having to wake up early for college classes fixes that; that's generally what happened in high school. College is creeping up on me fast; I only have two weeks of summer left! I should probably start preparing for moving in sometime soon,,,

Speaking of doing things soon, I need to hurry up and get ready because I have a haircut appointment in like two hours.


12:46
Got my haircut. It looks very strange to have such short hair since I've had long hair for so long, but I still think it looks pretty good. I was not aware until right before we left that I was being dropped off to go do it on my own, but I handled it better than I expected; I should probably be better equipped for this by now, though, seeing as how I'm going to be living on my own in two weeks,,,,

Meant to update this more yesterday, but I forgot. Doesn't bode well for the longevity of this blog, but we'll see. I got decent sleep last night; fell asleep around midnight and woke up at 09:00. Hoping I can get my sleep schedule into a decent state before college.

Anyway, it's my sister's birthday today! Yippee! I think we're gonna go see a movie later or something. We also got donuts for breakfast which is great.


23:35
Definitely am starting to forget to update this more often, but in my defense, I had quite a busy day!

I spent most of the day celebrating my sister's birthday with our mom and dad, and it was very fun. We ended it off by going to see the new Fantastic 4 movie, which, while it wasn't anything groundbreaking, I still really liked. It felt a bit like The Martian (2015), which is one of my favorite movies. Also, the end-credits scene is pretty exciting!

As for the time today we weren't together celebrating, I was playing Minecraft. I don't normally like ordinary single-player survival mode very much (I don't think I've played it seriously in years), but I recently watched (at the recommendation of a great friend) About Oliver playing it without any prior knowledge, and seeing him figuring out everything on his own really renewed my interest in the game (I recommend watching the edited-down supercuts of the playthrough by Eelis on YouTube). However, I have too much knowledge of the game to replicate Oliver's wonderment, so I decided to handicap myself by using commands to give myself only one heart of health. The resulting game-mode far more fun than I could have anticipated, and it completely changes how the game has to be played! Since every enemy can now kill you in one hit, you have to be incredibly vigilant whenever you're carrying anything valuable, and you have to make very excessive and creative use of beds to set your spawn. Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who is already very bad at staying alive in early survival mode, so if you're familiar with the game and fairly bored with normal survival, I would absolutely give this a try!
Here's the command you need to set your health: /attribute @s minecraft:max_health base set 2

This turned out to be a very long post; fitting for a very long day!

For the past week or so, I've been feeling very fatigued and low-energy all the time, with no discernable cause, but I think it's finally starting to go away, and I think I finally know what was causing it. Unfortunately, that knowledge came with the realization that I am very ill. I think I've been feeling fatigued all the time because my body has been allocating a bunch of its energy to my immune system. There were minor clues before-- occasional headaches and sneezing-- but I chalked it up to coincidence until this morning, where my nose has been super runny since I woke up two hours ago. Knowing that the fatigue is just sickness, though, is a relief, because that means it'll just pass.

In other news, I've spent most of my morning looking for a laptop for college, and I've found a decent Lenovo Thinkpad for $650 that I can turn into a good one for an additional ~$80 by adding more RAM and an external optical drive. Now, I just need to find a good distribution of Linux; I've been wanting to migrate to Linux for a while, and this seems like the perfect time.


20:12
$700 is too expensive! I found a similar Thinkpad on eBay with two key differences: the first is that this one is broken and sucks; the second is that it costs $40. Repairing it, however, will be FREE, and refurbishing it will only cost ~$175, which cuts the total price down to a third of buying a new one! I'll have to see if I can actually repair the thing before I can order the parts to make it not suck, though.


20:34
I had not before seen the magic of eBay, but now I understand. Laptop haggled for $30 (thanks, Mom!), the RAM I want should cost around $50, and I found someone selling a 4 TERABYTE SSD for FORTY DOLLARS!!!!!! I bought the SSD immediately because that seems like a once-in-a-lifetime deal. Total cost of this laptop should now come out to around $120. It's weird to think that I would have just ended up spending more than $600 extra for little to no reason if I hadn't taken Computer Security and Repair as an elective last school year. Thank you, Mr. Hughes!

Didn't feel great this morning, but the day is improving; not much has really happened, though. I heard that the Unofficial Homestuck Collection was being taken down, so I downloaded a copy for archival purposes (and because I wanna reread it sometime soon). Also, today is the 11th anniversary of the release of Five Nights at Freddy's, as well as the 12th anniversary of the release of Cookie Clicker, which is cool.

Probably should've updated more yesterday, but I wasn't feeling very good; I'm feeling better today, though. Speaking of yesterday, I watched a movie with my mom, The 5th Wave (2016), and it was fun (the movie was alright, but we laughed at a lot of the bad parts). I also discovered a webcomic, Normalsville, that I have since been reading obsessively. There's not very much content yet (I started reading from the beginning yesterday and I'm almost caught up), but what's there is pretty great; a lot of the strips have made me laugh out loud.

Speaking of webcomics that I really like, I recently caught up to present with El Goonish Shive, which I had been reading for about a year. The comic started in 2002, so there's 23 years of content, and each strip (except for a batch of early ones) has author commentary; the author advises against reading the commentary when first reading through, but that's what I did and I think it made it much more enjoyable. It's a very weird comic, and it starts off pretty rough, but I think it's definitely worth a try to read.

22:48
Had a pretty fun rest of the day. Went out to dinner with my mom and watched a movie with her. We saw War of the Worlds (2025) because I heard it was terrible (the newest addition to the coveted 0% club on Rotten Tomatoes!) and it certainly lived up to its reputation. If you like pointing out complete stupidity in movies, ESPECIALLY if you know stuff about computers, I would highly recommend watching this with some friends. I would recommend pirating it, though; the whole movie is basically one big (comically terrible) advertisement, so I advise against directly supporting films like this.

AAA! Almost forgot to update this today, mostly because not much happened. I helped my sister install new plastic flooring for her rabbit cage (and ended up cleaning a bunch of her room with our mom), but other than that, I pretty much just spent the day watching House M.D. and occasionally making little comics. I've been considering putting the comics in the Jabi Corner (that would help make it feel a bit less empty), but I'm thinking that I might want to wait until I'm sure I'll be making them somewhat consistently. I've also been considering making an RSS feed for these blog updates, which I might do, but I would have to update it manually to push the notification, and I fear that adding too many steps to updating the blog would make me do it less. If you couldn't tell, my brain is not very dependable.

Anyway, today was decent. I should go to bed now

I was gonna update this at 1 PM, but I couldn't think of enough to write and then it was 6 hours later; I have no clue where all that time went. My head doesn't feel right. I should probably use my computer less.

23:39
Went for a walk basically right after the prior update, and I've felt better since. I've been assuming that my fatigue problems have been way too pronounced to just have a behavioral cause, but maybe it is as simple as not looking at my computer all day. Now I feel a bit silly :p

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will probably be the only update I make today, because I have friends coming over later (Yippee!). The laptop got delivered, but I didn't realize that this model of ThinkPad needs its own charger, so we ordered one on Amazon that should arrive tomorrow. Also, my dentist appointment got moved up to tomorrow at 1, which is very convenient because it was formerly going to be on the same day that I moved into college. We made this appointment TWO MONTHS AGO, by the way! American healthcare is so terrible.

Last night was very fun. My friends and I watched Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009), which is a surprisingly fun watch. We also ended up watching all 33 chapters of R. Kelly's "Trapped in the Closet", which was very interesting. I would recommend checking it out if you haven't, but only the first 12; the later chapters mostly aren't as good in my opinion (and after too many, you're gonna start hating the instrumental).

Today was less fun. I went to the dentist, which was okay, and I got new toothpaste to help with my teeth sensitivity. After that, though, I spent basically the rest of the day freaking out over college costs; it turns out there is a bunch of stuff that we should have figured out way sooner. I think we'll get it under control, though.

Didn't update yesterday because it was very busy (but in a good way); I expect today to be also very busy, which is why I'm writing this right after waking up. Yesterday, I went over a bunch of financial stuff about college with my dad, and it turned out that we have way more time to handle things than we first thought, and we mapped out what loans to get and started applying for one. Then, all of us went out for family dinner night, and we all watched Breaking Bad on the TV after that. Somewhere in there, I also helped my buddy figure out an issue with his computer (I think we figured it out, at least; haven't heard back from him yet).

Today, I've gotta make sure we have everything on my checklist for my college dormroom (move-in is in 5 DAYS!!), finish the private loan application, do some online prerequisites for the federal loan, and go to my friend's birthday party at 7.

Yesterday wasn't quite as busy as I thought it would be, but I still didn't end up updating again :/. Today was quite busy, though; I had a ton of fun at the party last night, napped right went I got home (because I got about 20 minutes of sleep at the sleepover), then I got McDonald's with my mom and sister, and my mom and I went shopping for stuff I'll need in my dorm room. Still need to finish the loan applications and pack everything.

I feel like I should be better at keeping up with this blog. I know that it doesn't actually matter at all (and I probably still update it far more often than anyone checks for updates), but I still feel like a bit of an idiot for not being able to be consistent with something as simple and easy as this, which probably mostly stems from my annoyance at myself for not being to keep up with other stuff like exercise and reading and stuff. I think the main issues are that I either get too focused on what I'm doing to remember to do this stuff, or I'm so unfocused that thinking "I'll do it later" leads to me immediately forgetting. I think I might just have too much mental inertia; maybe if I get better at immediately switching to focusing on something else when I remember it, it'll be easier to do this type of stuff.

Meant to do a bunch of stuff today and ended up doing basically nothing. Better luck tomorrow! Bluh.

In preparation for classes, I set my 7 AM alarm last night and woke up early! Then, about an hour later, I got sleepy and went back to bed until 11. Oops. However, I will NOT let the rest of today go to waste; I will finish the student loan stuff and pack everything!

22:14
Well, I didn't do any of the student loan stuff, but I did pack a lot. Also I washed the towels and watched TV with family. I will call that a success!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:40
I am LOCKED IN! I woke up at 7, actually stayed up, started getting the federal loan stuff done, and went to the bank to set up a checking account and deposit my money. Now I've just gotta finish the loan stuff, finish packing, and do an OS re-install on my new laptop (which I keep forgetting to do).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gotta make this quick because there is still MUCH TO DO! Didn't update again yesterday because I spent the rest of the day finishing the federal loan stuff, packing mostly everything, doing the OS re-install, and having #DinnerWithBro (my buddy took me out to dinner). Still have to pack the last of my stuff, and then I'm MOVING IN! Not sure how we're gonna finish the private loan stuff but we'll figure it out I suppose.

18:24
Successfully moved in! I started this blog at a pretty convenient time; now it can mostly just document my experiences with college. It's kinda hard to believe I only started this blog about two weeks ago; it feels like it's been way longer than that.

Now actually being on my own, I have come to realize that I apparently have really bad social anxiety. Fortunately, it seems like I can suppress it by remembering that there is no good reason to have social anxiety, but I need to actively remind myself of that. I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of things that I'm supposed to do soon, but I don't really know that much about any of them because none of the info I got was in writing. The walls are also pretty thin, so I can usually hear people talking, and it kinda makes me feel like everyone is doing things and meeting people already, which isn't a great feeling when I am in my dorm room alone on my computer. Speaking of being alone, I haven't seen my roommate since he brought his stuff into the room like 5 hours ago, and I have no clue where he's been.

21:41
Went out to dinner and a "party" (university-organized) with two of my dormmates, and it was very fun! I was a bit worried that it might be hard to connect with them, but as per usual my fears were unfounded. My roommate still hasn't come back, though; not sure what the deal with that is. When he does come back I'll have to ask. All in all, though, I think this has been a pretty great start to college!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I went to residential orientation today, which was long and pretty boring; it was made more fun by my dormmates, though (although they left partway through, lol). Afterwards, I went to the cafe to get food, but I guess they stopped cooking or something because there was barely any food left to get, so I just got some okay soup and fruit. As it turns out, I am not a fan of soup. I guess I'll try to find a menu to figure out when stuff gets made. I also just remembered that I have family dinner in like an hour, so I probably should've only eaten a little (as it turns out, soup is surprisingly filling).
