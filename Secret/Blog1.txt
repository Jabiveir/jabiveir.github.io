Hello! Welcome to my awesome blog. This is basically going to function as public(ish) journaling; I've been thinking it would be cool, and I couldn't sleep tonight, so I figured now was as good a time to start as any. Now I'm thinking I should've thought this through a bit more, though, because I don't really know what to write now. I suppose I'll just write things as they happen and provide prior context as needed.

As I'm writing this, this blog is basically the only thing in the Jabi Corner, but I will probably put more stuff here in the future (like my non-blog musings and Guy 4 if I ever get around to actually working on it). I would just make this the normal website instead of a secret section of it, but I advertise(d) the website a bit too much, so I feel like it needs to appear semi-professional at least on the surface. Rest assured, this will be where the real magic happens,,,, (if I remember to put more stuff on it. And remember to update this blog)

If you have comments, questions, or et ceteras in response to any of my bloggings, you can always contact me at jabiveir2@gmail.com (or more direct methods, which, if you're here, you probably have).

Okay, I guess I did have a lot to write.

Finally, onto personal matters! I'm really hungry and I should have eaten dinner


10:12
Just woke up. Relatively early considering I went to bed at like 02:30 or something. My sleep schedule has been pretty bad all summer. Hopefully having to wake up early for college classes fixes that; that's generally what happened in high school. College is creeping up on me fast; I only have two weeks of summer left! I should probably start preparing for moving in sometime soon,,,

Speaking of doing things soon, I need to hurry up and get ready because I have a haircut appointment in like two hours.


12:46
Got my haircut. It looks very strange to have such short hair since I've had long hair for so long, but I still think it looks pretty good. I was not aware until right before we left that I was being dropped off to go do it on my own, but I handled it better than I expected; I should probably be better equipped for this by now, though, seeing as how I'm going to be living on my own in two weeks,,,,

Meant to update this more yesterday, but I forgot. Doesn't bode well for the longevity of this blog, but we'll see. I got decent sleep last night; fell asleep around midnight and woke up at 09:00. Hoping I can get my sleep schedule into a decent state before college.

Anyway, it's my sister's birthday today! Yippee! I think we're gonna go see a movie later or something. We also got donuts for breakfast which is great.


23:35
Definitely am starting to forget to update this more often, but in my defense, I had quite a busy day!

I spent most of the day celebrating my sister's birthday with our mom and dad, and it was very fun. We ended it off by going to see the new Fantastic 4 movie, which, while it wasn't anything groundbreaking, I still really liked. It felt a bit like The Martian (2015), which is one of my favorite movies. Also, the end-credits scene is pretty exciting!

As for the time today we weren't together celebrating, I was playing Minecraft. I don't normally like ordinary single-player survival mode very much (I don't think I've played it seriously in years), but I recently watched (at the recommendation of a great friend) About Oliver playing it without any prior knowledge, and seeing him figuring out everything on his own really renewed my interest in the game (I recommend watching the edited-down supercuts of the playthrough by Eelis on YouTube). However, I have too much knowledge of the game to replicate Oliver's wonderment, so I decided to handicap myself by using commands to give myself only one heart of health. The resulting game-mode far more fun than I could have anticipated, and it completely changes how the game has to be played! Since every enemy can now kill you in one hit, you have to be incredibly vigilant whenever you're carrying anything valuable, and you have to make very excessive and creative use of beds to set your spawn. Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who is already very bad at staying alive in early survival mode, so if you're familiar with the game and fairly bored with normal survival, I would absolutely give this a try!
Here's the command you need to set your health: /attribute @s minecraft:max_health base set 2

This turned out to be a very long post; fitting for a very long day!

For the past week or so, I've been feeling very fatigued and low-energy all the time, with no discernable cause, but I think it's finally starting to go away, and I think I finally know what was causing it. Unfortunately, that knowledge came with the realization that I am very ill. I think I've been feeling fatigued all the time because my body has been allocating a bunch of its energy to my immune system. There were minor clues before-- occasional headaches and sneezing-- but I chalked it up to coincidence until this morning, where my nose has been super runny since I woke up two hours ago. Knowing that the fatigue is just sickness, though, is a relief, because that means it'll just pass.

In other news, I've spent most of my morning looking for a laptop for college, and I've found a decent Lenovo Thinkpad for $650 that I can turn into a good one for an additional ~$80 by adding more RAM and an external optical drive. Now, I just need to find a good distribution of Linux; I've been wanting to migrate to Linux for a while, and this seems like the perfect time.


20:12
$700 is too expensive! I found a similar Thinkpad on eBay with two key differences: the first is that this one is broken and sucks; the second is that it costs $40. Repairing it, however, will be FREE, and refurbishing it will only cost ~$175, which cuts the total price down to a third of buying a new one! I'll have to see if I can actually repair the thing before I can order the parts to make it not suck, though.


20:34
I had not before seen the magic of eBay, but now I understand. Laptop haggled for $30 (thanks, Mom!), the RAM I want should cost around $50, and I found someone selling a 4 TERABYTE SSD for FORTY DOLLARS!!!!!! I bought the SSD immediately because that seems like a once-in-a-lifetime deal. Total cost of this laptop should now come out to around $120. It's weird to think that I would have just ended up spending more than $600 extra for little to no reason if I hadn't taken Computer Security and Repair as an elective last school year. Thank you, Mr. Hughes!

Didn't feel great this morning, but the day is improving; not much has really happened, though. I heard that the Unofficial Homestuck Collection was being taken down, so I downloaded a copy for archival purposes (and because I wanna reread it sometime soon). Also, today is the 11th anniversary of the release of Five Nights at Freddy's, as well as the 12th anniversary of the release of Cookie Clicker, which is cool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14:19
Probably should've updated more yesterday, but I wasn't feeling very good; I'm feeling better today, though. Speaking of yesterday, I watched a movie with my mom, The 5th Wave (2016), and it was fun (the movie was alright, but we laughed at a lot of the bad parts). I also discovered a webcomic, Normalsville, that I have since been reading obsessively. There's not very much content yet (I started reading from the beginning yesterday and I'm almost caught up), but what's there is pretty great; a lot of the strips have made me laugh out loud.

Speaking of webcomics that I really like, I recently caught up to present with El Goonish Shive, which I had been reading for about a year. The comic started in 2002, so there's 23 years of content, and each strip (except for a batch of early ones) has author commentary; the author advises against reading the commentary when first reading through, but that's what I did and I think it made it much more enjoyable. It's a very weird comic, and it starts off pretty rough, but I think it's definitely worth a try to read.

22:48
Had a pretty fun rest of the day. Went out to dinner with my mom and watched a movie with her. We saw War of the Worlds (2025) because I heard it was terrible (the newest addition to the coveted 0% club on Rotten Tomatoes!) and it certainly lived up to its reputation. If you like pointing out complete stupidity in movies, ESPECIALLY if you know stuff about computers, I would highly recommend watching this with some friends. I would recommend pirating it, though; the whole movie is basically one big (comically terrible) advertisement, so I advise against directly supporting films like this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/8/25

23:49
AAA! Almost forgot to update this today, mostly because not much happened. I helped my sister install new plastic flooring for her rabbit cage (and ended up cleaning a bunch of her room with our mom), but other than that, I pretty much just spent the day watching House M.D. and occasionally making little comics. I've been considering putting the comics in the Jabi Corner (that would help make it feel a bit less empty), but I'm thinking that I might want to wait until I'm sure I'll be making them somewhat consistently. I've also been considering making an RSS feed for these blog updates, which I might do, but I would have to update it manually to push the notification, and I fear that adding too many steps to updating the blog would make me do it less. If you couldn't tell, my brain is not very dependable.

Anyway, today was decent. I should go to bed now

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/8/25

18:53
I was gonna update this at 1 PM, but I couldn't think of enough to write and then it was 6 hours later; I have no clue where all that time went. My head doesn't feel right. I should probably use my computer less.

23:39
Went for a walk basically right after the prior update, and I've felt better since. I've been assuming that my fatigue problems have been way too pronounced to just have a behavioral cause, but maybe it is as simple as not looking at my computer all day. Now I feel a bit silly :p

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/8/25

15:01
This will probably be the only update I make today, because I have friends coming over later (Yippee!). The laptop got delivered, but I didn't realize that this model of ThinkPad needs its own charger, so we ordered one on Amazon that should arrive tomorrow. Also, my dentist appointment got moved up to tomorrow at 1, which is very convenient because it was formerly going to be on the same day that I moved into college. We made this appointment TWO MONTHS AGO, by the way! American healthcare is so terrible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13/8/25

19:22
Last night was very fun. My friends and I watched Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009), which is a surprisingly fun watch. We also ended up watching all 33 chapters of R. Kelly's "Trapped in the Closet", which was very interesting. I would recommend checking it out if you haven't, but only the first 12; the later chapters mostly aren't as good in my opinion (and after too many, you're gonna start hating the instrumental).

Today was less fun. I went to the dentist, which was okay, and I got new toothpaste to help with my teeth sensitivity. After that, though, I spent basically the rest of the day freaking out over college costs; it turns out there is a bunch of stuff that we should have figured out way sooner. I think we'll get it under control, though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15/8/25

10:41
Didn't update yesterday because it was very busy (but in a good way); I expect today to be also very busy, which is why I'm writing this right after waking up. Yesterday, I went over a bunch of financial stuff about college with my dad, and it turned out that we have way more time to handle things than we first thought, and we mapped out what loans to get and started applying for one. Then, all of us went out for family dinner night, and we all watched Breaking Bad on the TV after that. Somewhere in there, I also helped my buddy figure out an issue with his computer (I think we figured it out, at least; haven't heard back from him yet).

Today, I've gotta make sure we have everything on my checklist for my college dormroom (move-in is in 5 DAYS!!), finish the private loan application, do some online prerequisites for the federal loan, and go to my friend's birthday party at 7.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16/8/25

22:16
Yesterday wasn't quite as busy as I thought it would be, but I still didn't end up updating again :/. Today was quite busy, though; I had a ton of fun at the party last night, napped right went I got home (because I got about 20 minutes of sleep at the sleepover), then I got McDonald's with my mom and sister, and my mom and I went shopping for stuff I'll need in my dorm room. Still need to finish the loan applications and pack everything.

I feel like I should be better at keeping up with this blog. I know that it doesn't actually matter at all (and I probably still update it far more often than anyone checks for updates), but I still feel like a bit of an idiot for not being able to be consistent with something as simple and easy as this, which probably mostly stems from my annoyance at myself for not being to keep up with other stuff like exercise and reading and stuff. I think the main issues are that I either get too focused on what I'm doing to remember to do this stuff, or I'm so unfocused that thinking "I'll do it later" leads to me immediately forgetting. I think I might just have too much mental inertia; maybe if I get better at immediately switching to focusing on something else when I remember it, it'll be easier to do this type of stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17/8/25

23:33
Meant to do a bunch of stuff today and ended up doing basically nothing. Better luck tomorrow! Bluh.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18/8/25

14:07
In preparation for classes, I set my 7 AM alarm last night and woke up early! Then, about an hour later, I got sleepy and went back to bed until 11. Oops. However, I will NOT let the rest of today go to waste; I will finish the student loan stuff and pack everything!

22:14
Well, I didn't do any of the student loan stuff, but I did pack a lot. Also I washed the towels and watched TV with family. I will call that a success!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19/8/25

13:40
I am LOCKED IN! I woke up at 7, actually stayed up, started getting the federal loan stuff done, and went to the bank to set up a checking account and deposit my money. Now I've just gotta finish the loan stuff, finish packing, and do an OS re-install on my new laptop (which I keep forgetting to do).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20/8/25

8:49
Gotta make this quick because there is still MUCH TO DO! Didn't update again yesterday because I spent the rest of the day finishing the federal loan stuff, packing mostly everything, doing the OS re-install, and having #DinnerWithBro (my buddy took me out to dinner). Still have to pack the last of my stuff, and then I'm MOVING IN! Not sure how we're gonna finish the private loan stuff but we'll figure it out I suppose.

18:24
Successfully moved in! I started this blog at a pretty convenient time; now it can mostly just document my experiences with college. It's kinda hard to believe I only started this blog about two weeks ago; it feels like it's been way longer than that.

Now actually being on my own, I have come to realize that I apparently have really bad social anxiety. Fortunately, it seems like I can suppress it by remembering that there is no good reason to have social anxiety, but I need to actively remind myself of that. I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of things that I'm supposed to do soon, but I don't really know that much about any of them because none of the info I got was in writing. The walls are also pretty thin, so I can usually hear people talking, and it kinda makes me feel like everyone is doing things and meeting people already, which isn't a great feeling when I am in my dorm room alone on my computer. Speaking of being alone, I haven't seen my roommate since he brought his stuff into the room like 5 hours ago, and I have no clue where he's been.

21:41
Went out to dinner and a "party" (university-organized) with two of my dormmates, and it was very fun! I was a bit worried that it might be hard to connect with them, but as per usual my fears were unfounded. My roommate still hasn't come back, though; not sure what the deal with that is. When he does come back I'll have to ask. All in all, though, I think this has been a pretty great start to college!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21/8/25

17:10
I went to residential orientation today, which was long and pretty boring; it was made more fun by my dormmates, though (although they left partway through, lol). Afterwards, I went to the cafe to get food, but I guess they stopped cooking or something because there was barely any food left to get (and for burgers at least, they said "we're not making them right now"), so I just got some okay soup and fruit. As it turns out, I am not a fan of soup. I guess I'll try to find a menu to figure out when stuff gets made. I also just remembered that I have family dinner in like an hour, so I probably should've only eaten a little (as it turns out, soup is surprisingly filling).

17:21
Okay, so it seems like 3 PM to 5 PM is considered "Lite Lunch" which I can only assume means that they just leave out whatever they still have and then take a break from cooking. Notably, since I left the cafe just before 5, I just barely missed out on burgers (which are on the menu all day); though, with family dinner in like an hour, I guess that was a blessing in disguise. I just need to remember not to go to the cafe from 3 to 5, I guess.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22/8/25

11:49
Forgot to update again yesterday; family dinner was fun. I meant to also see about getting my bed lofted, but I ended up spending the rest of the night watching House :P. I'll look into it today.

I'm having trouble waking up to my alarms at 7 AM because my dreams are too interesting, which is a very strange problem to have. I don't end up remembering much from them, though; all I know from last night's dream(s) is that a very tall sort of turtle was involved, as well as a dog and maybe a cat. I think the turtle bit my finger at some point.

13:33
I looked into it, and it turns out they're out of the materials and stuff needed to loft beds, which is unfortunate because I wanted my desk facing the wall. I think I share the instinct that cats have when they eat with their back to the wall; having open space behind me while I'm using the computer makes me uncomfortable. Fortunately, I can always find a way to work with what I have (in this case: good spatial reasoning, a tape measure, and surprisingly high strength), so I spent the past hour or so moving all of my furniture around (while leaving my still-missing roommate's stuff untouched) to get my desk in a good position.

14:37
I am on CLOUD NINE right now; I just had a burger and fries in the cafeteria and it was AWESOME. And now I'm gonna watch the series finale of House! In my newly refurbished room! This world is wonderful

18:40
Lots of updates today! My roommate finally came back, and he seems like a really great guy! Apparently he was just really busy the past few days with stuff at home. Fortunately, he did not seem to mind my recent renovations, which is also very nice. It feels like today just keeps getting better and better; maybe I should go buy a lottery ticket!

Also, I forgot to mention this before, but I realized a little while ago what the cause was for my fatigue over the summer. It was mold!! I remembered that our shower curtain(s) kept getting mold growing on them, so I looked up the symptoms of mold toxicity, and while they can vary a lot, they seemed to fit very well. The only remaining mystery is why I consistently felt better after eating fast food, but I might just be able to chalk that up to caffeine; I always got a soda whenever we went out, and I stopped drinking soda at home a while ago.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23/8/25

14:23
Hung out with dormmates last night; was very fun. I've been spending most of today looking for hiring positions at the university for my mom, so I can get a full-tuition scholarship for having a parent employed full-time at the university. Speaking of which, the pay on all of these jobs is ridiculous! Maybe I'm just very privileged (having a mother in nursing and a father in I.T.), but the highest salary I've found has been 55k. Thankfully, the scholarship is maintained for four years of study even if the parent doesn't keep the job, so the pay cut is only needed for less than a year. Anyway, now that I've sent her a bunch of positions to apply to, I think I'm gonna watch through the Mission: Impossible movies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24/8/25

13:38
Meant to update again yesterday, but I forgot. I basically spent the whole rest of the day playing Plants vs. Zombies and watching YouTube. At about midnight, I FINALLY got the stupid achievement for getting to round 10 of the "I, Zombie" mode, which I only barely made happen because I got super lucky and got a board with just scaredy shrooms and a ton of sunflowers on round 2.

I watched the first half of Mission: Impossible last night, and I finished it just now. Pretty good movie, but I got kinda lost nearing the end and I didn't really know what was happening, though that's probably my fault; it definitely seems like a movie intended to be watched attentively in one sitting. I think I'm gonna continue watching the series.

Earlier today, I went to breakfast and the beach with my parents and a friend of theirs, and it was very fun. The pancakes weren't good though; they had a very strange taste, like there was weird strawberry flavoring in them or something. If they wanted to put their own spin on pancakes, that's fine, but then they maybe should have actually said that they were unique instead of literally listing them on the menu as "Boring Pancakes".

I'm going to my university's "FestiFall" in like two hours, which is supposed to be kinda like a convention for all the clubs, which is pretty neat. I definitely wanna join at least one club; making my own would also be really cool, but I don't really have any ideas. I could do "Jabiveir Club" but I have no clue what that would entail. Maybe I could make it a cult!

22:00
FestiFall was okay; signed up to hear more from (I think) two clubs. Haven't started Mission: Impossible 2 yet, but I watched Superman (2025) and it was pretty good. Classes finally start tomorrow; my first college class will be calculus 3 at 9:30 in the AM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25/8/25

16:30
Classes were pretty easy, which makes sense since it was the first day, but what was NOT easy was getting through it with my body fighting me the entire time. I could barely get up from bed, my face was uncomfortable from being sunburnt (from like maybe three hours of being outside yesterday), my left ear hurt because I have an acne cyst on the floor of the concha cavum, I got a nosebleed right before I had to go to class, and I almost fell asleep during my second class. I got through it though because I am a champion and I am unstoppable. After that I watched K-Pop Demon Hunters (2025), which was pretty good; I liked the songs. Anyway I'm gonna play Terraria and watch Mission: Impossible 2 now

21:56
Seems like my body only really wanted to mess with me during class; I've had basically no issues aside from an annoying bump on my inner cheek. Anyway, I finished Mission: Impossible 2, and it was really good. It starts off with an action cold open, followed by some less captivating setup which makes it seem like it, for lack of a better phrase, blew its load early; I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not at all the case, though. I would definitely recommend watching this one. In retrospect, I think I would have enjoyed the first movie a lot more if I was paying more attention :P

I kinda feel like I'm not doing enough college stuff (particularly socializing), but my roommate has pretty much said that he feels the same way, so I don't feel too worried about it (although he still does more stuff than me, so maybe I should be a bit worried about it). I've been thinking about setting up a JabiChat server for the campus and just putting up posters or something to see how many people I can get on it. The university has its own network (naturally), so I could set up a LAN-only server where only the students (and I guess staff if they want) could join. Unfortunately, since moving here, my computer seems to mysteriously turn off when I leave it idle for too long (something to do with the power/outlets, I imagine), so it might be hard to run a server consistently.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26/8/25

18:08
Haven't felt great today. I feel like I've been constantly messing stuff up, but when I tried to think of specific examples to write here, the only things I could really think of are either understandable or don't really matter at all. I guess it's just that thing where you're in a bad mood so you're brain tries to trick you into feeling worse for no reason.

Unfortunately, I do have some good reason to feel bad, because I just got a cold sore on my lip and it SUCKS. They're not really that uncomfortable on their own, but the fact that touching it can cause it to spread and make new ones pop up forces me subconciously to be constantly vigilant about not touching it and not letting it touch my other lip, which is VERY tiring and discomforting. Fortunately, I have some weird essential oil stuff that my mom got me that is surprisingly effective at getting rid of cold sores. Also, writing this paragraph made me realize that I also have cold sore patches and pills tucked away, so it'll hopefully get knocked out in no time!

I think this is the most noticeably useful that this journaling has ever been for me.

In lighter news, I tried lettuce and tomato on a burger today, and it is a GAME CHANGER! It doesn't really taste much better or worse, but it's quite a bit healthier, and tomatoes are supposed to be really good for acne (unless you're allergic. Which I think I'm not). I also tried cranberry juice, which isn't great, but it's tolerable and supposedly also good for acne. It's not good for teeth because of its acidity, but it's still a lot better than the Dr. Pepper that it will be replacing; I knew soda was sugary, but I didn't realize it was so acidic!

21:49
Had a whole list of stuff that I wanted to get done today, and then I spent all of my time after class watching YouTube and playing Plants vs Zombies. Bluh. Aside from my regret, though, I'm feeling pretty good, so that's nice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27/8/25

19:19
I feel pumped right now, and I'm not really sure why. It's awesome though! I've just started getting a bunch of stuff done off of my to-do list. It's a bit confusing, since this was preceded by watching a bunch of YouTube and browsing Reddit, which usually makes me lethargic. I did take a nap earlier, which might've given me energy for now? I must figure out how to harness this power,,,

Speaking of napping, I keep falling asleep in class!! The first two days I chalked it up to coincidence, but now it's officially a pattern (since it has now happened at the same time in the same class as Monday). I'm trying to listen to the professor when I start gradually finding it more and more impossible to keep my eyes open. I'm able to (figuratively) pry them back open after like a few seconds, but then I just quickly get super tired again and the cycle repeats! Also, I'm almost positive that I was genuinely dreaming during those few seconds, and every time there's a point where I can just suddenly stay awake with no issue (still being tired though :P), which makes me think that I'm actually somehow sneaking in deep REM sleep or whatever in that time. Fortunately, this implies that something like a 20 minute nap between classes should hopefully solve the issue. Shouldn't be necessary, though; I'm already getting like 9 hours of sleep each night >:T

0:04
Okay, I might get less than 9 hours tonight (-_-'). My energy mostly went away after I ate (right after the prior post), but my good mood stayed, which is nice. What is not nice, however, is that good mood plus low energy usually ends up with me spending the day watching YouTube and browsing Reddit. Today was no exception. But! I got some stuff done for Intro to Ethics just now. Okay cool bedtime now good night

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28/8/25

21:04

Late update today, but deservedly so; today was very long! For starters, I WOKE UP LATE! That'll teach me to stay up until midnight, I suppose. Fortunately, Thursdays happen to be the only day of the week where I don't have Calc 3 at 9:30 AM, so I ended up starting the day with basically the same amount of time to get ready before class. Also, while I'm not sure if it was because I woke up late or because I had a soda for lunch, I didn't fall asleep in class today!! I don't even recall getting tired, which is awesome. Also also, I love my classes!!! Despite the fact that we're learning stuff that I already know in Microecon (for now), I was very much enjoying following along, and my Arduino class just had us fiddling with Arduinos and breadboards, the entertainment value of which I shouldn't have to explain.

After classes, I got back to my dorm, checked up on my messages, and IMMEDIATELY started getting work done! I'm pretty sure I haven't opened up YouTube or Reddit once today! I feel very proud of myself for this. In fact, from when I got back at 4 PM until a few minutes ago, I've been doing pretty much nothing but getting stuff done. And eating that one time. And getting a call from my sister! IDK if she'd be okay with me sharing her situation on a pseudo-public blog, so I won't go into detail, but she called me today and she's doing good, which is very nice. I'll see her and my parents when I go home for Labor Day weekend, which is conveniently tomorrow.

I would feel even better about how much work I got done, but most of it was stuff that should have been done during my Arduino class, and I only had to do it as homework because I was running behind, my laptop died during class (and I didn't bring the charger), and most of the stuff I had done to that point was formatted wrong. But! Now I know exactly what I'm doing, which means that the class will be easy breezy from here on out. I also did a little introduction post to my online Ethics class for extra credit, which this blog helped prepare me for! I used to be very terrible with writing about myself, and now I'm decent at it! Yet another surprising benefit stemming directly from this blog.

I also only realized it was time to take my cold sore pill a few minutes ago because I had to write the blog timestamp. Speaking of which, the cold sore seems to already be going away, which, if so, means that I knocked this thing out in RECORD TIME; Usual trajectory for these things lasts like 10 days. I guess my full frontal assault plan of taking three kinds of medication for it at once worked! The acne cyst in my ear has also basically gone away, which is very nice. Now that I'm thinking about it, all my physical issues I've mentioned in recent have either gone away or are in the process of going away; even my acne in general is getting better. Very nice! (Borat voice)

So, suffice to say, today was very very good. I could get some more work done, but I think I'm just gonna take a break. I think this is my longest blog post yet!

Done with my first full week of college! All of my classes seem fun so far, which is great. I'm mostly caught up on stuff, but I think there's a little homework that I have to do over the weekend. I'll have to do it on my laptop, since I'm back at home for the weekend! It's been very nice to see my cats again, and I guess my family too (joking, of course). Anyway, speaking of my laptop, I have been STRUCK WITH TRAGIC NEWS! I was completely misled by the specs on the laptop listing, and it turns out that it only has ONE SLOT for DDR3 RAM!!! This means that, having 4 GB of RAM (completely terrible), I can upgrade it AT MOST to 8 GB of RAM (still completely terrible). I'm particularly miffed by this, because I just recently started thinking that I could make this laptop my personal computer instead of my PC (ironically). But! There are a few silver linings. For one, it's still decent enough as is to use for classwork, which is how I've been using it so far. Also, it's poor performance could actually end up being a *good* thing, as I can use it to test the games and stuff I make, which will force me to optimize them very well. Lastly, we literally already have another laptop that I can use that will probably be able to be upgraded to my liking; I only stopped using it because the keyboard wasn't working well, but literally as I was typing up this post (after having complained about my Thinkpad woes to my parents), my dad came in, remembering the old laptop, and offered to replace the keyboard for me! The only real downside is that the design of the keyboard and trackpad are much nicer to use on the Thinkpad versus the other laptop, but that's not really a huge issue. I would also say that I like the durability of the Thinkpad line, but I have an 11e, which was designed primarily to be cheap, so I'm not really certain of how durable this thing actually is.

Anyway, the idea of making a JabiChat server for the campus has re-invigorated my programming spirit, so I've gotten back into working on it (especially since I didn't bring my PC, so I don't really have anything more fun to do LOL). The only real feedback I've gotten on the public hosting release (since my two friends that I asked to test the guide never did >:T) was that SQL was annoying/confusing to install, so I thought of making my own "database" (a formatted text file and an interpreter in the code) proprietary to JabiChat, so that hosts won't have to bother setting it up themselves. I also wanna try putting in some new features before hosting it on-campus. I know that pretty much no one's gonna actually end up using it, but pretending otherwise is the only real way I can get work done, and getting work done is the only real way I can have a good time.

SHOOT! DANG IT! SHAZBAT! ET CETERA!!!

I forgot the blog :[

I knew that I forgot yesterday, but I genuinely didn't realize until just now that I also forgot on Saturday. Drat! It was mostly because I didn't have my normal setup with me at home, so I had to make the updates directly on GitHub. That isn't actually really any more difficult than what I do normally, but I would like to blame it on that.

Anyway, the weekend was very fun. I did a lot with family, I went to board game night with a bunch of my friends, and I finally worked out how to make my database idea function properly! I still need to actually implement the new database structure, which will be very, very time-consuming, but it will (hopefully) also be fun. I didn't get any of my homework done (oops) but luckily none of it was due over the weekend (although something is due tomorrow so I should probably work on that).

At board game night, we played Jabi Party, a very bad board game that I made, and Scythe, which is an actually very good game. I had never played it before, and it was a bit confusing to learn, but it's very fun once you get the hang of it.

I was very wrong a few days ago when I said my cold sore was going away, as I've still had it the entire weekend, but now it finally IS going away (I think), which is nice. It will probably be fully gone within the next day or two, which is still faster than usual.

Almost forgot again,,,

Not much happened today. Went to classes, started doing homework, got distracted, still haven't finished homework due in 3 hours. Should probably finish that.

Also I just realized that I forgot to even put the time for yesterday's post. I am really not doing too well with this stuff,,,

I really gotta start doing more stuff; I feel like I have nothing to write in here. Classes were fun today.

I didn't go to the job fair today, but that's because (aside from it being IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL DAY and requiring me to skip my second class to show up) all of the positions offered seem to be either federal work-study jobs, which I don't qualify for, or student assistant jobs, which wouldn't qualify me for tuition assistance. I don't know if I've mentioned on here yet or not, but I'm basically boned financially if I don't get some sort of big scholarship, and I don't want to just keep hoping my mom gets a job here, so I'm looking into getting a job here myself, which (for most positions) comes with paid tuition. I don't really know why, but I think I'd really enjoy a janitorial position, so I'm gonna try and find someone to ask about whether there's any openings for that. At some point. Bluh.

AAA!!! I forgot the time again on the last post!! I gotta get myself on a more strict schedule I think. I've always struggled with that, but now that I'm at college (and I don't have anything going on that could interrupt a schedule), I think I can start developing a strong one. These little mistakes and stuff are just gonna keep snowballing if I don't start getting consistent with these things.

Anyway, I looked at my homework, and I found out that I had math homework due yesterday that I didn't know about. Dammit. I cleared out the useless notifications on the stupid site for classes, so now I should actually be able to easily see when stuff is gonna be due, and I got halfway through the new math homework due next week. I should probably do more, but I'm gonna play Terraria now.

Bwah!! I keep feeling like I'm wasting the day,,,, But! I don't really have toooo much homework and stuff to worry about, so I guess it's not too bad. I'm definitely gonna work on some before bed. I've been watching Inception, and it's seeming pretty cool; I would say I'd update later with a full review, but I'm considering making movie and show reviews a different part of the Jabi Corner, because it's looking pretty barebones.

Also, I've wanted for a while to make a program that functions as an advanced to-do list and schedule, wherein you get points and doodads for doing your stuff (and bonuses for being consistent, doing 100%, etc.), and I tried making something for it a month or so ago, but I got tired of making it before I even got close to finishing. However, my Intro to Programming class (in which we are, for some reason, learning Excel) made me realize that a simple spreadsheet would actually be the perfect medium for this kind of thing. I think having something like this would give a massive boost to my consistency with getting all my stuff done, so I really wanna make it soon.
