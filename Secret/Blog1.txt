Hello! Welcome to my awesome blog. This is basically going to function as public(ish) journaling; I've been thinking it would be cool, and I couldn't sleep tonight, so I figured now was as good a time to start as any. Now I'm thinking I should've thought this through a bit more, though, because I don't really know what to write now. I suppose I'll just write things as they happen and provide prior context as needed.

As I'm writing this, this blog is basically the only thing in the Jabi Corner, but I will probably put more stuff here in the future (like my non-blog musings and Guy 4 if I ever get around to actually working on it). I would just make this the normal website instead of a secret section of it, but I advertise(d) the website a bit too much, so I feel like it needs to appear semi-professional at least on the surface. Rest assured, this will be where the real magic happens,,,, (if I remember to put more stuff on it. And remember to update this blog)

If you have comments, questions, or et ceteras in response to any of my bloggings, you can always contact me at jabiveir2@gmail.com (or more direct methods, which, if you're here, you probably have).

Okay, I guess I did have a lot to write.

Finally, onto personal matters! I'm really hungry and I should have eaten dinner

Just woke up. Relatively early considering I went to bed at like 02:30 or something. My sleep schedule has been pretty bad all summer. Hopefully having to wake up early for college classes fixes that; that's generally what happened in high school. College is creeping up on me fast; I only have two weeks of summer left! I should probably start preparing for moving in sometime soon,,,

Speaking of doing things soon, I need to hurry up and get ready because I have a haircut appointment in like two hours.
