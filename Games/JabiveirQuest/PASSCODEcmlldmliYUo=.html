Jabiveir!? Stunned by this incredible revelation, Jabiveir continues looking through the lab, and finds that Jabiveir's purpose was to split the universe into seperate timelines by making choices, and that technology to traverse these timelines was already developed to abuse this power. Jabiveir was created for the sole purpose of becoming the leader of an industry, then the world, then the multiverse. Flabbergasted by these shocking plot twists, Jabiveir uses experience from working in a lab (right at the start of the game, remember?) and developes a machine that would hopefully allow the control of these actions that led to Jabiveir ruling the multiverse in the first place, and, not having any other way to complete the device, ports the neural network of Jabiveir's brain into the device, and sends it to a higher plane of existence, in the hopes that the higher beings will make the right choices, and stop Jabiveir's rule. Oh yeah baby, it's me. I was Jabiveir the whole time and you didn't even know! And also I made the game. How many plot twists can we even fit in one page!? Only that many, actually, because that's it. Thanks for playing!</p><br/><hr/><br/><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="/JabiveirQuest/Ending19.html">Ending 19</a><br/><br/></p></body></html>
